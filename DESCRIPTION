Description: Solves for the recursive representation of the stable solution to a system of linear difference equations. Inputs are two square matrices E and A and a natural number n where E and A are the coefficient matrices of the difference equation Ex(t+1) = Ax(t). The output of the package are (currently) two functions g and h for the decision rule and the law of motion respectively.
